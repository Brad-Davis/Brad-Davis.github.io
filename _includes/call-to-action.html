                        <p>
                            For the past couple of months, I have been working with friend and fellow co-founder Yoon Jung Kim on planning and creating a website which is striving to
                            create a platform for local business to host events and workshops in a social media-esque setting. We are still early in the development process, but we plan
                            to have an early iteration of the site up by late spring. I have focused on learning what the full stack development process is like, dedicating my time to 
                            learning backend setup using react.js and firebase for database management.
